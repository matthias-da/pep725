\title{Calculate Daylength (Photoperiod)}
\usage{
calc_daylength(doy, lat)
}
\arguments{
\item{doy}{Integer or numeric vector. Day of year (1-365/366).}

\item{lat}{Numeric. Latitude in decimal degrees. Positive for Northern
Hemisphere, negative for Southern Hemisphere.}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\describe{
\item{daylength}{Daylength in hours}
\item{declination}{Solar declination angle in degrees}
}
If \code{doy} is a vector, returns a data.frame with these columns.
}
\description{
Computes the astronomical daylength (hours of daylight) for a given
day of year and latitude. Photoperiod is an important environmental
driver of plant phenology.
}
\details{
The calculation uses standard astronomical formulas based on the
solar declination angle. The formula assumes a "flat horizon" and
does not account for atmospheric refraction, elevation, or local
topography.

At polar latitudes (|lat| > 66.5), continuous daylight or darkness
may occur around solstices.

\section{Phenological Relevance}{

Many phenological events are triggered by photoperiod thresholds:
\itemize{
\item Spring bud burst often requires both temperature accumulation
and minimum daylength
\item Autumn leaf senescence may be triggered by shortening days
\item Flowering in many species is photoperiod-dependent
}
}

\examples{
# Daylength at spring equinox (DOY 80) at 50°N
calc_daylength(80, 50)

# Summer solstice at different latitudes
calc_daylength(172, c(30, 45, 60))

# Daylength through the year at 45°N
yearly <- calc_daylength(1:365, 45)
plot(yearly$doy, yearly$daylength, type = "l",
     xlab = "Day of Year", ylab = "Daylength (hours)")
