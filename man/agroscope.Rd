\description{
This dataset contains phenological observations from Agroscope winter wheat field trials in Switzerland. It includes sowing, heading, and harvest dates for different wheat varieties and locations (postal codes) over multiple years. These data are typically used for model calibration and validation of crop phenology under Swiss agroclimatic conditions.
}
\details{
The dataset originates from Agroscope’s official winter wheat variety trials. Observations cover multiple varieties and locations, providing key phenological stages (sowing, heading, harvest) required for climate impact assessments, phenological model calibration, and sensitivity analyses. Missing values in the \code{Variety} column indicate unclassified entries but retain valid phenological dates.
