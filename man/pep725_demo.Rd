\title{Demonstrate the pep725 Package Functions}
\usage{
pep725_demo(which = "all", pause = interactive())
}
\arguments{
\item{which}{Character vector specifying which demos to run. Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"class"} - Demonstrate the pep class (print, summary)
\item \code{"filter"} - Show data filtering and selection
\item \code{"plot"} - Display visualization capabilities
\item \code{"analysis"} - Show analysis functions (normals, anomalies)
\item \code{"all"} - Run all demonstrations (default)
}}

\item{pause}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), pauses between demos
waiting for user input. Set to \code{FALSE} for non-interactive use.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list containing example outputs from each demo.
}
\description{
This function provides an interactive demonstration of the main features
of the pep725 package for PEP725 phenological data analysis. It showcases
data exploration, filtering, summarization, and visualization capabilities.
}
\details{
The demonstration downloads synthetic PEP725 data using \code{pep_download()}
and walks through typical workflows for phenological data analysis:

\enumerate{
\item \strong{Class demo}: Shows the enhanced print and summary methods
for the pep class, demonstrating how to quickly understand the data.
\item \strong{Filter demo}: Demonstrates selecting specific species,
phases, and time periods using data.table syntax.
\item \strong{Plot demo}: Creates visualizations including station maps,
time series, and DOY distributions.
\item \strong{Analysis demo}: Shows phenological normals calculation,
anomaly detection, and data quality assessment.
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Run all demos interactively
pep725_demo()

# Run specific demos
pep725_demo(which = "class")
pep725_demo(which = c("filter", "plot"))

# Run without pausing (for scripts)
pep725_demo(pause = FALSE)
}
