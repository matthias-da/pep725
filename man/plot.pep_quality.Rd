\title{Plot Method for Data Quality Assessment}
\usage{
\method{plot}{pep_quality}(
  x,
  which = c("overview", "grades", "completeness", "scatter"),
  title = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{pep_quality} object.}

\item{which}{Character. Type of plot to produce:
\itemize{
\item \code{"overview"} (default): Multi-panel overview with grade
distribution, completeness histogram, and completeness vs outliers
\item \code{"grades"}: Bar chart of quality grade distribution only
\item \code{"completeness"}: Histogram of completeness percentages only
\item \code{"scatter"}: Scatter plot of completeness vs outlier percentage
}}

\item{title}{Optional character string for the plot title.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (unused).}
}
\value{
A ggplot object (invisibly for \code{which = "overview"}).
}
\description{
Creates a multi-panel visualization of phenological data quality metrics,
including grade distribution, completeness histogram, and the relationship
between completeness and outlier percentage.
}
\examples{
\donttest{
pep <- pep_download()

# Assess quality for Swiss stations
pep_ch <- pep[country == "Switzerland"]
quality <- pep_quality(pep_ch, by = c("s_id", "phase_id"))

# Overview plot (default)
plot(quality)

# Individual plot types
plot(quality, which = "grades")
plot(quality, which = "completeness")
plot(quality, which = "scatter")
