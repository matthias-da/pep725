\title{Assess Data Coverage of PEP725 Phenological Data}
\usage{
coverage(
  x,
  kind = c("all", "temporal", "geographical", "species"),
  top = 10,
  plot = FALSE,
  by = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{pep} object or data.frame with phenological data.}

\item{kind}{Character. Type of coverage to assess:
\itemize{
\item \code{"all"} (default): All coverage types combined
\item \code{"temporal"}: Year range, gaps, observations per year
\item \code{"geographical"}: Countries, stations, coordinate ranges
\item \code{"species"}: Species and genus diversity
}}

\item{top}{Integer. Number of top entries to show in tables (default: 10).}

\item{plot}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, produces a visualization of the
coverage. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{by}{Character. Optional grouping variable for more detailed analysis
(e.g., \code{"country"}, \code{"species"}). Only used for temporal coverage.}
}
\value{
A list of class \code{pep_coverage} containing coverage statistics.
The structure depends on \code{kind}:
\describe{
\item{temporal}{Year range, number of years, gaps, observations per year}
\item{geographical}{Countries, stations, coordinate bounds, altitude range}
\item{species}{Genera, species, subspecies counts and details}
\item{all}{All of the above combined}
}
}
\description{
Provides comprehensive coverage statistics for phenological datasets,
including temporal, geographical, and species dimensions.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
pep <- pep_download()

# Full coverage report
coverage(pep)

# Temporal coverage only
coverage(pep, kind = "temporal")

# Geographical coverage with plot
coverage(pep, kind = "geographical", plot = TRUE)

# Species coverage, top 5
coverage(pep, kind = "species", top = 5)

# Temporal coverage by country
coverage(pep, kind = "temporal", by = "country")
}
