\arguments{
\item{pep}{A \code{data.table} or \code{data.frame} with phenological observations.
Required columns depend on \code{color_by}:
\itemize{
\item Always required: \code{lon}, \code{lat}
\item For \code{"n_species"}, \code{"mean_doy"}, \code{"species_cv"}: \code{species}
\item For \code{"mean_doy"}, \code{"trend"}: \code{year}, \code{day}
}}

\item{location}{Named vector with center longitude and latitude for the map.
Defaults to near Changins: \code{c(lon = 6.233, lat = 46.400)}.}

\item{zoom}{Zoom level for the map (default: 4 for Europe-wide, 7 for regional).}

\item{color_by}{Character. What to color stations by:
\describe{
\item{"none"}{Black points showing station locations only}
\item{"n_obs"}{Number of observations per station}
\item{"n_species"}{Number of species recorded per station}
\item{"mean_doy"}{Mean day-of-year (phenological timing) per station}
\item{"trend"}{Trend in days/year per station (positive = later, negative = earlier)}
\item{"species_cv"}{Coefficient of variation in timing across species at each station
(higher = more variation among species)}
}}

\item{phase_id}{Integer. BBCH phase code to filter by. Recommended for
\code{"mean_doy"} and \code{"trend"} to ensure meaningful comparisons.
If \code{NULL} (default), all phases are included.}

\item{period}{Integer vector of years to include. Default is all years.
For trend calculation, at least 10 years are recommended.}

\item{min_years}{Integer. Minimum years required for trend calculation.
Stations with fewer years show as NA. Default is 10.}

\item{min_species}{Integer. Minimum species required for \code{species_cv}.
Default is 3.}

\item{point_size}{Size of station points (default: 0.8).}

\item{output_file}{Optional file path to export the plot (e.g. \code{"map.pdf"}).}

\item{key}{Google Maps API key (you can set globally via \code{register_google()} instead).}
}
\value{
A ggplot map object.
}
\description{
Generates a map of PEP725 phenological station locations with optional coloring
by various statistics including mean phenological timing, trends, and species
variation.
}
\details{
The new color options provide insights into:
\itemize{
\item \strong{mean_doy}: Spatial patterns in phenological timing. Earlier
timing (lower DOY) typically in southern/lowland areas.
\item \strong{trend}: Where phenology is advancing (negative = earlier over time,
shown in blue) or delaying (positive, shown in red). Uses Kendall's tau
normalized statistic for robustness.
\item \strong{species_cv}: Stations where different species show similar timing
(low CV) vs. divergent timing (high CV). High variation may indicate
species-specific responses to local conditions.
}
}
\section{Interpreting Trends}{

The trend is calculated as Kendall's normalized tau statistic, which ranges
roughly from -3 to +3 for typical data:
\itemize{
\item Negative values (blue): Phenology is getting earlier over time
\item Positive values (red): Phenology is getting later over time
\item Values near 0: No clear trend
\item |tau| > 1.96: Statistically significant at 95\% level
}
