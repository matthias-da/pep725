\title{Daily Hail Probability Data for Austria, Germany, and Switzerland}
\format{
A data frame with 4,392 observations and 9 variables:
\describe{
\item{Subdomain}{Character. Geographic subdomain identifier
(e.g., \code{"Austria"}, \code{"Switzerland"}, \code{"Germany"}).}
\item{DOY}{Integer. Day of year (1–365 or 1–366).}
\item{mean}{Numeric. Mean daily hail probability across all grid cells
belonging to the subdomain and scenario.}
\item{q5}{Numeric. 5th percentile of the daily hail probability distribution
across grid cells (lower uncertainty bound).}
\item{q95}{Numeric. 95th percentile of the daily hail probability distribution
across grid cells (upper uncertainty bound).}
\item{n_cells}{Integer. Number of model grid cells contributing to the
aggregated hail probabilities for that subdomain.}
\item{area}{Numeric. Total area (in km² or model units) covered by the
grid cells included in the aggregation.}
\item{Country}{Character. Country code or name used for grouping in
analyses (e.g., \code{"Austria"}, \code{"Germany"}).}
\item{Scenario}{Character. Climate scenario identifier, typically including
\code{"ctrl"} (historical control simulation) and future scenarios.}
}

\description{
This dataset contains daily hail probability estimates derived from
convection-permitting climate simulations. It includes mean hail probability,
lower and upper uncertainty bounds, and spatial metadata (number of grid
cells and total area) for each day of the year (DOY), for each country and for
multiple climate scenarios.
}
\details{
The dataset is provided as a \code{data.table} / \code{data.frame} with 4,392 rows
(365–366 DOY × countries × scenarios) and nine variables.

The hail probabilities are derived from climate simulations using a
convection-permitting model. The values represent \strong{aggregated hail
occurrence probabilities}, averaged across all cells belonging to each
country’s subdomain.

This dataset is typically used for:
\itemize{
\item climate impact assessments,
\item phenology–hail overlap studies,
\item agricultural risk modelling,
\item scenario comparisons (CTRL vs. PGW/SCEN).
}
