# Summary

Phenological observations are a key source of evidence for biological responses to climate variability and change. The Pan European Phenology database (PEP725; @templ2018pep725, @templetal2026a) is an open-access infrastructure for plant phenology data, unifying more than 13 million observations from over 30 countries, spanning the period from 1868 to the present and covering approximately 265 plant species and 46 phenophases. While these datasets offer exceptional scientific value, their analysis is challenged by uneven spatial coverage, heterogeneous data quality, temporal gaps, and changes in observation protocols over time.

The **pep725** R package provides a coherent framework for the spatio-temporal analysis of phenological data from PEP725 and similar ground-based datasets. It supports systematic data quality diagnostics, the computation of phenological normals and anomalies, the estimation of spatial gradients along environmental axes, the assessment of phenological synchrony across space and time, and both interactive and publication-ready spatial visualization. The package emphasizes reproducibility and transparency and is designed to complement phenological modeling and remote-sensing tools by enabling a phenology-first exploration of spatial structure and variability in large, heterogeneous observation networks.

# Statement of need

Several R packages support phenological research, including tools for mechanistic modeling, statistical estimation, climate–phenology relationships, and satellite-derived land surface phenology. These tools are indispensable for prediction and process-based understanding, but they typically operate on pre-processed inputs and emphasize modeling outcomes rather than the spatial structure and reliability of large observation networks.

Ground-based phenological datasets however pose various analytical challenges. For instance, observation density varies strongly across regions, long-term records are often incomplete, and data quality and observation protocols differ among contributors and time periods. Without explicit diagnostics and spatial characterization, such heterogeneity can bias spatial comparisons, trend analyses, and downstream model calibration.

The **pep725** package fills these methodological gaps by providing a dedicated, quality-aware framework for characterizing station-based phenological datasets prior to modeling. It enables systematic data quality assessment, quantification of spatial gradients, evaluation of phenological synchrony, and spatial visualization of phenological patterns. It is particularly suited for continental-scale datasets such as PEP725 but remains applicable to any station-based phenological data with spatial coordinates. By separating data diagnostics and spatial characterization from downstream modeling, **pep725** enables more robust and reproducible phenological analyses.

# Functionality

The core functionality of **pep725** is organized around four complementary tasks that support the exploratory and diagnostic stages of phenological analysis prior to modeling and inference.

First, the package provides reproducible data quality assessment for phenological time series. It quantifies temporal coverage, identifies data gaps and statistical outliers, and assigns interpretable quality grades that can be used to filter, stratify, or weight subsequent analyses.

Second, **pep725** supports the computation of phenological normals and anomalies, analogous to climatological normals. These summaries provide consistent reference baselines for comparing phenological timing across periods, regions, and species.

Third, the package includes tools for analyzing spatial structure in phenology. It enables estimation of elevational and latitudinal gradients in mean phenological timing and quantifies phenological synchrony, capturing spatial coherence and variability in timing within regions and across years.

Finally, **pep725** integrates interactive and static spatial visualization. Interactive station selection supports exploratory data analysis and region definition, while static, publication-ready maps allow spatial patterns in phenological metrics to be communicated without reliance on proprietary mapping services.

The package follows a modular design and deliberately avoids embedding specific climate datasets or phenology–climate models, allowing users to integrate **pep725** outputs with external climate data and modeling frameworks according to their research questions.

# State of the field

Phenological analysis in R is supported by various packages that address complementary aspects of data modeling, prediction, and interpretation. Many tools focus on process-based or statistical modeling of phenology, often using climate covariates as primary inputs. For example, **chillR** [@luedeling2012chillR], provides a comprehensive framework for modeling chilling and forcing requirements in temperate fruit trees, including bloom prediction and climate scenario analysis. Similarly, **DyMEP** [@tschurr2025dymep] implements dynamic, weather-driven phenology models for major crops, offering mechanistic prediction across environments based on long-term meteorological data. Crop-specific modeling and parameterization are further addressed by **phenolocrop** [@tanigu2025phenolocrop], which focuses on growth stage transitions and machine-learning-based prediction from time-series traits.
Other packages emphasize statistical estimation of phenological timing from irregular or presence-only data. **phenesse** [@phenesse2025applies] applies quantile regression approaches to estimate onset, median, and end dates of phenophases, enabling robust inference from opportunistic observations. The **phenology** package provides parametric and Bayesian models for fitting seasonal distributions of biological events, originally developed for animal phenology but applicable more broadly [@girondot2010phenology]. Auxiliary workflows for preprocessing and basic phenological calculations are supported by packages such as **pheno** [@Schaberpheno2026] and **spphpr** [@shi2017spphpr], which implements thermal-time-based spring phenology prediction models. The **sephora** [@Gomezsephora2024package] package provides function and methods for estimating phenological dates from (nearly) periodic Earth Observation time series.
A parallel line of development targets remote-sensing-based phenology, where land surface phenology is derived from vegetation indices rather than ground observations. Packages such as **npphen** [@chavez2023npphensupport] focuses on the detection and characterization of vegetation anomalies from remote-sensing time series; while tools like **phenex** provide function for spatial analyses of satellite observations of vegetation [@Langephenex2017]. These approaches are essential for large-scale mapping but operate on fundamentally different data structures than the PEP725.

####### TODO: cite: phenomap, and Hufkenss package phenor, so any package that deals with PEP725 - must check again

In contrast, **pep725** focuses on the spatial–statistical characterization of ground-based phenological observation networks. It emphasizes data quality diagnostics, spatial gradients, synchrony, and exploratory mapping, thereby filling a methodological gap between raw phenological databases and downstream modeling or prediction-oriented software.

# Software design

The design of **pep725** is guided by three principles: (i) explicit treatment of data quality and uncertainty, (ii) transparent and reproducible spatial analysis workflows, and (iii) modular integration with the broader R ecosystem.

Functions operate on tabular phenological data with explicit spatial and temporal attributes and return structured outputs that can be reused across analytical steps. Gradient and synchrony analyses share consistent interfaces and support robust estimation methods to reduce sensitivity to outliers and heterogeneous sampling. Visualization tools are integrated directly into the workflow to support iterative exploration, region definition, and communication of results.

# Research impact statement

The **pep725** package has been developed in close connection with the analysis of the PEP725 database and related phenological observation networks. It supports a wide range of applications, including the assessment of spatial phenological gradients, evaluation of regional synchrony, identification of high-quality stations for trend analysis, and preparation of reproducible figures for scientific publications.

By providing a dedicated framework for quality-aware spatial analysis, **pep725** lowers the barrier to working with large phenological datasets and promotes more transparent and comparable phenological research. The package has been adopted in climate impact studies, ecological analyses, and teaching contexts focused on phenology and environmental data analysis.
